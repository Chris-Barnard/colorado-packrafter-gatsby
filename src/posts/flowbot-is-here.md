excerpt: "I created an easy tool to watch an American Whitewater gauge for it to hit a certain level, and then it will send you an email notification."

I created this a while back as local python script to help me keep track of some of the AWW gauges.  I thought that maybe it could be useful for the community, so I decided to put it online for everyone to use.

You can enter in a link to a AWW page as well as a target flow, and be notified when the flow is either above, or below based on your preference.
