I created this a while back to help me keep track of some of the AWW gauges and thought that maybe it could be useful for the community.  You can enter in a link to a AWW page as well as a target flow, and be notified when the flow is either above, or below based on your preference.  

You can check it out <a href="/flowbot">here</a>!
